# UI-Challenge

It doesn't quite build...but it runs! You can see the code in action with the command line:

Run `gradlew bootRun` at the root directory and go to `http://localhost:8080/hello` to see SpringBoot in action.
You can add `?name=xyz` at the end of the url to change 'world' to any string!

In the `home/` directory run `ng serve --open` to see the Angular page and the Hello World task.
